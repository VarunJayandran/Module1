# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
3. Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
   
   - If true, print "EVEN".
   - Else, print "ODD".
   
4.End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
a=int(input("Enter a number: :))
if a%2==0:
   print("Even")
else:
   print("Odd")
```
## Output

## Result
a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements is successful

# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.

2.Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.

3.Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.

4.Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.

5.Print the value of a with the label "a is".

6.Print the value of b with the label "b is".

7.Print the value of c with the label "c:".

8.Print the value of d with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
```python
a = (1 == True)

b = (1 == False)

c = True + 3

d = False + 7

print("a is True")
print("b is False")
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
```
## Output

# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Print the character 'T'.

2. Print the character 'a'.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
v = 'T'
w = "a"
print(v)
print(w)

```

## Output
![439862283-0255541f-e2f5-4241-9e0b-6acee8a41614](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c4acf7f-aeb1-4bbc-baec-d4ed7ec193b2)


## Result
a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals is successful

# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part). 
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
3.Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
4. Print the complex number x.
5. Print the real part of x using x.real. 
6. Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

## ðŸ’» Program
```python

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
## Output

# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.

2. Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
   
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
